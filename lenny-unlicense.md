# [The Unlicense JhonnyJason style](https://github.com/JhonnyJason/lenny-unlicense)

All our work is free to be inspected dissected and used for your own purposes without any warranty or restrictions.
We also dare to use others work in any way it helps us.

This unlicense is a claim to free ourselves from dealing with licencing issues. 
We don't want them and we don't want to impose them on others. 

Further you may read into our ideas about this issue. 

---

- Information has no ownership.
- Information only has memory to reside in and relations to be meaningful.
- Information cannot be stolen. Only shared or destroyed(= made inaccessible).

And you wish it has been shared before it is destroyed.

Where does the desire to limit the free propagation of information come from?

Probably unnecessary fear and lack of awareness. 
Lack of awareness about where all the information came from originally.
Fear of being disposable as soon as somebody else has extracted all the information from us.
Fear of being inferior and the exposed information opens us to the attack which causes our ultimate defeat.

Probably in combination with the idea that information is power. Well no... power is power.

I suppose this is to a large part due to a misunderstanding how power works. This combined with the own self being involved in the power struggle.
If you are involved in the power-struggle then it is very easy to regard information merely as a tool for your aims.

Ultimativly the power-struggle is it's own game and in this game you use everything as a tool - people, relationships, information. You will always play it on some level - just don't totally loose yourself in it.

**We need to look at the world from outside of the power-struggle.**

The power-struggle is the worst distraction from life - the greatest fallacy of human-kind. 

It is highly attractive to fall for it. Sometimes it seems to be the only way to find fame, glory or money.
Looking at the world from outside the power-struggle you might see that it's effects are merely destructive overall. If we overexaggerate it - the only result will be our self-destruction. 

If the evil wins - then everything is destroyed.
If the good wins however - the evil will still coexist with it. 

Seems yet over all of time the good has prevailed. :wink: 

So also within us we do coexist with our evil sides - the challenge is to deal with it appropriately in such a way that it rather helps us than destroys things. Therefore we are concious, we can see, we can feel, we can balance, we can adjust and we can guide ourselves - navigate.

Information is immensely valuable. 

However the value is not in them who "created" the information. The value is within you. 
How you manage to use it, for your optimal navigation flow.

Nobody has ever "created" information. In abstract all information has always been there. 
The game of life is sequentially bringing possibilities to life.

This progression goes step, by step by accessing, reconnecting and distributing possible information. Level X generates next generation information. Level X+1 should reach all the possible information of Level X - retrieve what makes sense in the specific context (this filtering is crucial) then reconnect it to generate the next generation information for Level X+2.

Basically learning, reconnecting and sharing on every level. 

**This is how we develop to evolve.**
